# PROJECT 7: PACMAN CAPTURE THE FLAG

In Harvey Mudd's Artificial Intelligence course (CS 151), our projects are licensed from [UC Berkeley's CS 188](http://ai.berkeley.edu). Each of the seven projects has involved a game scenario using Pacman and ghosts as AI agents as we program Pacman to perform according to the concept we're learning at the moment.

# The problem: capturing the flag
This project is a Capture the Flag contest between two teams in a Pacman maze. The red team defends the left half of the maze, and the blue team defends the right half of the maze. There are two agents on each team; when an agent is in its home territory it is a ghost, and when it is in enemy territory it becomes Pacman. One team wins if its agents eat all the pellets in enemy territory within the given time limit of the game.
