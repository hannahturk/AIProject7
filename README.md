# PROJECT 7: PACMAN CAPTURE THE FLAG

In Harvey Mudd's Artificial Intelligence course (CS 151), our projects are licensed from [UC Berkeley's CS 188](http://ai.berkeley.edu). Each of the seven projects has involved a game scenario using Pacman and ghosts as AI agents as we program Pacman to perform according to the concept we're learning at the moment.

This project is a Capture the Flag contest between two teams in a Pacman maze.
